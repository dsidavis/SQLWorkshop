In this workshop, we'll discuss how to use relational databases from
within R, when to use them, different database models and
implementations (client-server and standalone), the database ecosystem
in R and the computational model.  We'll focus on using existing
databases and the basic elements of SQL mentioning some of the more
advanced ideas and features (e.g. R functions as user-defined
functions in SQL). As participants want, we can discuss the process
and design of creating databases, NoSQL, distributed databases, and
other related topics.
