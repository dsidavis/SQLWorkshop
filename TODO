[done] Get instances of Postgres running locally.
     MySQL??
      
     cd ~/postgres
     ./bin/initdb -D ~/postgres/DATA
     ./bin/pg_ctl -D /Users/duncan/postgres/DATA/ -l logfile start
     ./bin/createdb duncan

     Now
        ./bin/psql

              create table foo (x int, y real);

              \d
	      \conninfo


         INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, 2);
         INSERT INTO foo VALUES (100, 22);

         select * from foo;


   Can other people connect to this server?
   
    Change the pg_hba.conf file in the DATA/ directory.
    Change the trust to md5 in the line
    # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
    local   all             all                                     trust


    Now connect via RPostgreSQL

    drv = PostgreSQL()
    con = dbConnect(drv)
    dbListTables(con)

     [1] "foo"

   CREATE user dtl with password 'JustChecking';

   as superuser (not dtl)
     ./bin/createdb dtl

  Then login to a separate account, e.g., dtl2
   The psql -U dtl

  drv = PostgreSQL()
  con = dbConnect(drv, "dtl", "JustChecking2")
