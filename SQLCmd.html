# SELECT

SELECT is the workhorse of most SQL queries.

1. Get one or more columns from a table
```{sql}
SELECT * FROM orders;
SELECT amount FROM orders;
SELECT amount, order_date FROM orders;
```

---
# SELECT - filtering rows

+ Use the WHERE clause as part of the SELECT
+ Specify conditions which include/exclude rows.

```{sql}
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 100;
```
```{sql}
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE state = 'VA';
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name = 'James';
```

---

# Comparison operators

+ We intuited = and > operators
+ Also <,  >=, <=, <>  (not equal)

+ `IN` operator
```{sql}
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name IN ('John', 'James');
```

+ LIKE operator for string comparisons
   + `column LIKE pattern`
   + Pattern similar but different to regular expressions
   + % - zero or more characters
   + _ - any single character
```{sql}
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE zipcode LIKE  '22%';
```

+ `BETWEEN`
```{sql}
SELECT customer_id, amount FROM  orders WHERE amount BETWEEN 20 AND 80;
```


---

# Gotchas with SQL LIKE operator

+ Can be different in each SQL engine

+ LIKE can be case insensitive.

+ May need to escape the special symbols.
   
+ SQLite has GLOB function
   + case sensitive & uses UNIX shell wildcards

---
# WHERE with Multiple Conditions


+ Combine conditions with AND, OR

```{sql}
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE state = 'VA';
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 100 AND customer_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name = 'James' OR last_name = 'Adams';
```

+ Negate the condition with NOT

```{sql}
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE NOT state = 'VA';
```

---

# Useful Qualifiers for SELECT

+ Filter the rows returned in the result set wi
  + DISTINCT
  + LIMIT,
  + ORDER BY 

+ `SELECT  DISTINCT `
```{sql}
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders;
```
   + Note appears just after SELECT and applies to one or more columns
   + DISTINCT means entire row
      +  A B  and A C are distinct
	  +  A and A are not distinct
	  +  A B   and A B are not distinct

---
# LIMIT and ORDER BY

+ Post-processing the result
   + LIMIT - give the first n rows
   + LIMIT n OFFSET o - n rows starting from the o-th row
   + ORDER BY - order the results by one or more columns in the result set

+ LIMIT
```{sql}
SELECT * from orders LIMIT 2;
SELECT * from orders LIMIT 2 OFFSET 3;
```

+ ORDER BY variable name(s)
```{sql}
SELECT * from orders ORDER BY amount;
SELECT * from orders ORDER BY amount, customer_id;
```

+ Can change the order of ORDER BY from increasing to decreasing with, e.g.,
```{sql}
ORDER BY amount DESC;
```

---

# Why use Qualifiers from R?

+ Can do the filtering in R

+ What's the difference between

#### 1  LIMIT
```{sql}
a = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Table;")
a[1:50, ]
```
and
```{sql}
a = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Table LIMIT 50;")
```

#### 2 ORDER BY
```{sql}
a = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Table;")
a[order(a$x), ]
```
and
```{sql}
a = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Table ORDER BY x;")
```

+ Issue is tradeoff between minimizing data transfer and computations in R
  + Do computations locally where the data reside and reduce data

---

# Missing Values in SQL

+ SQL uses NULL to represent a cell whose value was not specified.
+ Maps to NA in R.

+ Can check in SQL for NULL with `IS NULL`

```{sql}
SELECT * from orders WHERE date IS NULL;
```

---

# Functions in SQL

+ 3 different types of functions 
   + records (one or more scalars from a single row)
   + aggregates (applies in GROUP BY operations on subsets of records)
   + triggers (when insert a record)
   
+ SQL mandates a minimal but useful set of functions   

+ Postgres provides many functions
   + https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions.html      
   
+ Each engine provides its own set
  + Hard to rely on as non-standard existence, parameters, or operation.
  
+ But many engines allow  extensions to be dynamically added.



---
# Record Functions in SQL 

+ Use in the column selection for results
```{sql}
SELECT amount * 1.075 FROM orders;
SELECT ROUND(amount) FROM orders;
SELECT SUBSTR(last_name, 1, 5) FROM customer;
```

+ Getting months from the order
```{sql}
SELECT SUBSTR(order_date, 1, 2) FROM customer;
```
   + But generally, we need to use powerful date functions.

+ Use in filtering - no cents!
```{sql}
SELECT *  FROM orders WHERE ROUND(amount) = amount;
```

+ SQLite3 has very few builtin functions.  
  + There  are many extensions
  + We can define our own!!

---
# Aliasing Column Names

+ Convenient to give names to or rename columns in results
  + `SELECT amount * 1.075 FROM orders;`
  + has a column name `amount * 1.075`!

+ Instead give useful name via `AS` 
```{sql}
SELECT amount * 1.0925 AS TaxedTotal FROM orders;
```
+ Can have an `AS` for any column in result.
```{sql}
SELECT amount * 1.0925 AS TaxedTotal, date AS shippedDate FROM orders;
```

---

# Aggregate Functions

+ Work on a a subset  (possibly all) of the recodes

+ COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG - builtin/ standard

```{sql}
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
```

```{sql}
SELECT MIN(amount) AS MIN, MAX(amount) AS MAX FROM orders;
```


---
# Functions in SQL or R

(Back to whether to do in R or SQL)

+ What about scalar functions 
```{sql}
a = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT log(x) FROM table;")
b = log(dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT x FROM table;")[[1]])
```

+ Not all functions in SQL
+ If R function is vectorized - fast.
   + If not, perhaps(?) faster in SQL
   
+ What about
```{sql}
a = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT log(x) FROM table WHERE x > 0;")
b = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT x, log(x) FROM table;")
b[b$x > 0,]
```

<!--
     This back to doing things locally, reducing the data transfer.
     Also, does log(x) make sense if x <= 0. What do we get from the
     db. In other examples, the result may be an error or nonsense.
     So filtering has to be done locally.
   -->

---
# GROUP BY

+ Analogous to split(), tapply()/by()/aggregate() in R

+ We apply one or more functions to aggregate the subgroups

```{sql}
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
```

+ Combine with `ORDER BY`
```{sql}
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders 
   GROUP BY customer_id
   ORDER BY total DESC;
```


---
# HAVING

+ How do we subset the results of a GROUP BY ?
  + Do it in R after getting the results
  
+ In the database before results are returned?
  + Use the `HAVING` clause on the result of the GROUP BY
  
```{sql}
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING total > 100;
```
  
+ Note referencing column alias `total` in the HAVING clause
